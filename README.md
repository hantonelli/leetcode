# Description
This repo contains my solution to leetcode problems. It also contains solutions from other people, all sol_fast.go and sol_fastest.go are from other people that had been able to solve the problem more efficiently.

# Test
The test contains the test cases that I face when solving the problems, but they are not complete test cases. These are just for me to at least solve the basic cases tested on my own environment.

# Problem
The description of the problems can be found in the website, I didn't include it here as this is just for personal use and the website should be used as the main resource. Also I recommend looking at the discussion of the problems on the website, as they include really useful information and tips.
